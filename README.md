# Crime-Trend-Analysis-and-Visualization-project
This project offers a structured method to identify and analyze crime patterns and trends. It provides visualizations of crime occurrences across different timeframes, such as year, month, day, and hour, as well as by crime category. Users can toggle between various crime types for specific months, with corresponding locations plotted on an interactive map.
